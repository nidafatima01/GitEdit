GIT =>
Git is a tool used to keep track of changes to files, especially the code of the projects. It is termed a distributed version control system because of its behaviour to allow multiple people to work on the same project, even if they are not connected to a common server.

Reason to Choose Git
Distributed System: Every developer has a complete local copy of the project.

Performance: Git is fast and efficient, handling large projects with ease.

Collaboration: Tools like GitHub enhance team collaboration, code reviews, and project management.

Track Changes: Git tracks changes and maintains a history, making it easy to revert to previous versions.

#Steps to Setup a Git
Install Git: Download and install Git from the official Git website.
